# Application Requirements Documentation

This documentation outlines the requirements for the GitHub project "Application Requirements." The project aims to create a web application with specific features and functionality. Below are the detailed requirements for each component of the application.

## 1. Navigation Bar (5 pts)

- Implement a navigation bar that allows users to navigate the application.
- Navigation links should correctly change the current screen or view.
- For guests (unauthenticated visitors), display links to the Home Page, All Memes page, Login, and Register pages.
- For logged-in users, the navigation bar should include links to the All Memes page, Create Meme, Welcome, user's email address, My Profile, and a Logout action.

### User Navigation Example:
Guests (un-authenticated visitors) can see the links to the Home Page, All Memes page, as well as the links to the Login and Register pages. 

### Guest Navigation Example:
The logged-in user navbar should contain the links to All Memes page, the Create Meme page, Welcome, { userâ€™s email address }, My Profile page and a link for the Logout action.
